SampleCache Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SampleCache is a cache of sample codes for getting started with CBEffects.

These samples are for those who want a bit less to start out with - the sample app can be a bit overwhelming at first glance. These samples will be updated and added to as time goes on.


List of Samples:

BeginnerSamples - Simple for beginners
	BasicVent - How to create and start a VentGroup
	DoubleVent - Including more than one vent in a VentGroup
	LoadPreset - Loading a preset
	HelloWorld - Using build functions
	HelloWorldRandomized - Using build functions
	Ring - Use of posRadius and posInner
	TouchPoint - Adding basic interactivity to a VentGroup

FieldGroups - Using FieldGroups
	BasicFieldGroup - Linking up a FieldGroup with a VentGroup
	RepelField - Basic interactivity and field presets
	AttractField - Basic interactivity and field presets
	MultiFieldGroup - Including more than one field in a FieldGroup

Physics - Adding physics behavior to VentGroups
	Angles - Using angle parameters
	Box2D - Adding Box2D physics to particles
	Gravity - Using the effect of gravity on particles

That's it for now, but I'll be adding new ones as time goes on.
